# Dependencies
Pypi packages listed in requirements.txt

# Building

Before you build, make sure to download a vosk model and extract it in the 'resources' folder for speech to text and add 'faces' (found in 'resources') to the 'faces' folder for facial recognition.

Use 'pip install -r requirements.txt' in the root folder to make sure prerequisites are installed.

To build, run 'init.py'.

I recommend using python 3.8

# Issues

You may have to use 'pipwin' instead of 'pip' to install 'pyaudio'.
To install 'pipwin', run 'pip install pywin' in Command Prompt.
